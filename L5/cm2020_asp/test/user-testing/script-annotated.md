# User Testing #2 Script
Things the test administrator may want to watch for have been included in _italics_ under the corresponding step.

In addition to general functionality and navigation, we wanted to test some specific scenarios. These scenarios are as follows,
with their corresponding steps where they are tested:
 - How easy is it to get to a module leaderboard from different places on the website?
	- From the homepage: 'General Navigation': step 2
	- From My grades: 
		- If module is in My grades: 'General Navigation': step 4 and 'Edit': step 2
		- If module is not in My grades: 'General Navigation': step 6
 - From the homepage, does the user prefer Add Grade button in nav or Program Overview?
	- 'Add': Step 1
 - Does the user get a good sense for how they compare to others?
	- 'Status' Comparison: All steps

## Context and Instructions
Gradez is a website for University of London Students. The goal is to 
give students a place to keep track of their grades and see how well

	- _Did they struggle to get to this leaderboard?_
3. Find which modules the Demo User has submitted grades for
	- _Did they get to 'My grades' from either the nav button or the profile icon pop-up menu? If so, which?_
4. See the module leaderboard for one of the Demo User's submitted grades
	- _Did they get there from 'My grades'?_
5. Go to My grades and take note of modules the demo user has submitted a grade for
6. Go to a module leaderboard which Demo User has NOT submitted a grade for
	- _Did they know to go back to home then find program overview?_

3. Go to the leaderboard for Algorithms and Data Structures I
	- _Did they struggle to get to this leaderboard?_
4. Enter a grade for Algorithms and Data Structures I

## Edit
1. Having entered a grade for Algorithms and Data Structures I, change the session, grade, and privacy setting.
2. Visit the leaderboard for Algorithms and Data Structures I to verify changes
	- _How did they get there? Did they backtrack to homepage or did they realize there is a link in My grades?_

## Status Comparison
- _These should be difficult for the user to complete_
1. Find the Demo User's rank out of all the students
